# Drop your site images here. These will be served statically by Vite/React.

Recommended structure:
- images/hero: homepage hero backgrounds
- images/news: news/article cover images
- images/logos: partner and brand logos (prefer SVG/PNG with transparency)
- images/gallery: general photos for galleries

Referencing:
- In code/JSON, use root-relative paths like "/images/hero/cover.jpg"
- Avoid spaces in filenames; use dashes
- Prefer optimized dimensions (hero: ~1920x1080, news: ~1280x720)
- Compress images (80â€“85% JPEG quality) for performance
