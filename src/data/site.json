  "aboutUs": "ADV Juansiksty Nation is more than a riding group—it’s a family. We unite ADV 160 owners from all over the Philippines, guided by respect, service, integrity, and teamwork. With our members and partners, we build not just rides, but lasting friendships and shared experiences.",
  "history": "Founded in October 2022 and headed by Kap Arki (John Arnie Bonete), ADV Juansiksty Nation Roundtable was built on the foundation of its Core Values—manners, service, integrity, and teamwork. From the start, the vision was to create a safe and genuine community for motorcycle enthusiasts, free from toxicity, spam, and negativity.\n\nExclusively uniting proud owners of the Honda ADV 160 scooter, the group quickly grew from casual rides into a national brotherhood. More than just a riding club, it became a true home where camaraderie thrives, experiences are shared, and support is always present—on and off the road.\n\nToday, under Kap Arki’s leadership, ADV Juansiksty Nation Roundtable continues its journey across the open road—guided by passion, strengthened by values, and bonded by the spirit of family.",
